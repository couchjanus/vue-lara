## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Laravel Sanctum (https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/sanctum)

## Install Laravel Sanctum.
```
composer require laravel/sanctum
```
Publish the Sanctum configuration and migration files using the vendor:publish Artisan command. The sanctum configuration file will be placed in your config directory:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"
```
Run your database migrations to create a database table in which to store API tokens:
```
php artisan migrate
```
Add the Sanctum's middleware to your api middleware group within your app/Http/Kernel.php
### ../app/Http/Kernel.php
```php


use Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful;

...

    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        ...

        'api' => [
            EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,
            'throttle:60,1',
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ],
    ];

    ...
],
```
## Tokens for users
To use tokens for users, we have to add HasApiTokens to the User model in app/User.php.
### ../app/User.php 
```php


use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, Notifiable;
}
```
## Let's create the seeder

Let's create the seeder for the User model. 
We'll need that a bit later to test the login proccess.
```
php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder
```
Now let's insert
```php
DB::table('users')->insert([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@doe.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('password')
]);
```
into the run() function in database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php

To seed users table with user, let's run:
```
php artisan db:seed --class=UsersTableSeeder
```
So now we have a new user in our database called John Doe with email john@doe.com and password password.

## Let's create a /login

Let's create a /login route in the routes/api.php file:
### ../routes/api.php
```php


use App\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

Route::post('/login', function (Request $request) {
    $data = $request->validate([
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required'
    ]);

    $user = User::where('email', $request->email)->first();

    if (!$user || !Hash::check($request->password, $user->password)) {
        return response([
            'message' => ['These credentials do not match our records.']
        ], 404);
    }

    $token = $user->createToken('my-app-token')->plainTextToken;

    $response = [
        'user' => $user,
        'token' => $token
    ];

    return response($response, 201);
});
```
## Let's send a POST request

Let's send a POST request with email john@doe.com and password password as parameters to the http://my-app.test/api/login route. You can use the Postman(https://www.postman.com/) or Insomnia(https://insomnia.rest/) software packages to accomplish this.

If everything is working well, we will receive a JSON object as response to our request:
```php
{
    "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@doe.com",
        "email_verified_at": null,
        "created_at": null,
        "updated_at": null
    },
    "token": "AbQzDgXa..."
}
```
## Next, we need to change some middleware. 
We do this in the /routes/api.php file by replacing auth:api with auth:sanctum:
```php
../routes/api.php

Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
```
## CORS handling
Before we continue to the front end, we have to setup cross-origin requests CORS handling.

### ../config/cors.php
```php


    'paths' => ['api/*', 'login', 'logout'],

    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],

    'allowed_origins' => ['*'],

    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],

    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],

    'exposed_headers' => [],

    'max_age' => 0,

    'supports_credentials' => true,

```
### ../.env
```php
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=127.0.0.1
```
